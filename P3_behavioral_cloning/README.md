# Behavioral Cloning Project

This project features a 52 parameter squeezenet variant model that can drive around the Udacity car simulator! Check out [writeup_report](https://github.com/mez/carnd/blob/master/P3_behavioral_cloning/writeup_report.md) file for a detailed report on this project.

## The following files are included:

1. model.py containing the script to create and train the model
2. drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
3. model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network
4. writeup_report.md summarizing the results
5. other helper files neeeded by model.py and drive.py

## Running the Model

0. git clone this repo
1. Open terminal and run `python drive.py model.h5`
2. Download the simulator and start it in autonomous mode.
3. Grab a tasty beverage and enjoy.

## Training the Model
