    "What a time to be alive! The year is 2017, Donald Trump is president of the United States of America and autonomous vehicles are all the rage. Still at its infancy, the winning solution to dominate the mass production of autonomous vehicles are ongoing. The two main factions currently are the robotics approach and the end-to-end neural networks approach. Like the four seasons, the AI winter has come and gone. It's Spring and this is the story of one man's attempt to explore the pros and cons of the end-to-end neural networks faction in a controlled environment. The hope is to draw some conclusions that will help the greater community advance as a whole.\n",

It has two modes, training and autonomous mode. Training mode is for the human to drive and record/collect the driving. The result would be a directory of images from three cameras (left, center, right) and a driver log CSV file that records the image along with steering angle, speed etc. Autonomous mode requires a model that can send the simulator steering angle predictions. \n",

The blog post linked shows a 63 parameter model that uses tiny images and a small network to get a stable model. I wanted to experiment and see if I could make it smaller and still stable.

    "This model combats overfitting by being super tiny and for kicks I added a small dropout layer. The model works on both tracks and has a six second epoch on my late 2012 macbook air!! From the comma.ai model, it was evident that a validation loss of around 0.03 on 30% of **this** dataset results in a stable model that can handle the track at a throttle of around 0.2, which is a speed of around 20mph in the simulator. So, I didn't bother worrying about the hyperparameter on how many epochs to train. I simply created a custom early termination keras callback that stopped the training when we hit our requirement.\n",
